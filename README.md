## 🧩 My Process
The development process was straightforward and iterative:
1. **Component Structure** – Broke down the UI into reusable React components.
2. **Styling** – Used **CSS Flexbox** and a **mobile-first** approach for responsive design.
3. **Responsiveness** – Added **media queries** to optimize the layout for desktop screens.
4. **Testing** – Wrote **unit and integration tests** to ensure component stability and interaction accuracy.
